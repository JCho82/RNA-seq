# Environment settings

First you should be able to use all codes in Conda environment.
If you don't have it, please contact your server administrator since intalling the Conda/anaconda would be prohibited by yourself.

### When you have access to conda

You may have to write code like this or your server administrator may set up a path for you to use conda.

```bash
source /optnfs/common/miniconda3/etc/profile.d/conda.sh
```
